# Time Table CRUD Manager – Problem Statement & Scope

## Problem Statement

Managing class schedules manually often leads to confusion, overlapping timings, and lack of proper organization. Teachers and administrators need an efficient way to store, update, and organize class timetables in a structured manner without relying on complex database systems or large applications. A simple, beginner-friendly, easy-to-run application is required to handle core timetable operations.

## Scope of the Project

The project focuses on building a command-line based CRUD manager that:
• Stores timetable information using JSON files
• Uses only core Python libraries
• Allows basic operations such as add, view, update, and delete
• Ensures conflicts such as overlapping classes are prevented
• Is simple enough for beginners to understand and extend
• Follows object-oriented design principles
The scope does not include GUI features, networking, multi-user login, or cloud storage.

## Target Users

• Students who want to manage personal study schedules
• Teachers planning their class timings
• Timetable coordinators in schools or colleges
• Beginners learning Python OOP concepts
• Developers looking for a simple reference project for CRUD operations

## High-Level Features

• Create new timetable entries with all necessary details
• Read/list all existing entries
• Update any part of an entry including subject, teacher, room, time, and notes
• Delete entries safely with confirmation
• Detect and prevent time conflicts for the same teacher or room
• Store data persistently in JSON without external databases
• Cleanly structured code with OOP principles and modular design
